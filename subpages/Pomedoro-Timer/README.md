With this project I create a Pomodoro-timer with a milky glass design. I have seen this design in several videos and found it very interesting, so I wanted to try it out.

TODO:
- implement the pause button feature. ✅
- implement a random quote generator. ✅
- implement SPA structure. ✅
- Integrate Spotify and Apple music API
- Integrate login system
- Add statistics.

BUGS:
- As soon as a time of 100+ min is set, the time is recorded incorrectly. fix this.
- as soon as the timer is started, it feels like it takes 2 seconds before it really starts. fix it.
- As soon as a button is clicked, it gets stuck in the :active state. fix. ✅
- Add responsiveness for mobile devices.
